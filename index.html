            <p><h2>not a kid</h2>
            this song is about seeing life from an adult's perspective. 
            in a different way than usual</p>
            <p><h2>work makes no money</h2> about effort for nothing,
            living in a country where you have no idea if you're gonna have a job or
            whatever, and this is your life, you gotta deal with failure. I put failure as a lady who stole my peace</p>
            <p><h2>too tiny too huge</h2>about big dreams and some plans</p>
            <p><h2>(too tiny)</h2>about inner limitation 'cause of people's expectations</p>
            <p><h2>mad world</h2>personal problems</p>
            <p><h2>introspection</h2>personal actions and thoughts</p>
            <p><h2>long life little living</h2>i made this song after i had a lot of time to
            think about what i've been doing with myself and my life in the last four years
            may be about regret.</p>
            <p><h2>keep body and soul together</h2>to my best friend, not an advice, only self projection</p>
